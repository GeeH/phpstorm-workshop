      local changes (what has edited/added/deleted in the changeset).
   Open the "Log" tab to see what has been going on in the VCS repository.
2. Explore the history. You can see the commit message, files that have been changes, the author and when the change happened.
3. From the toolbar, you can filter on user, date and search for keywords in commit messages.
4. Select the last commit (the top one in the list). From the files on the right, open a "diff" with the previous commit (Ctrl+D or Command+D).
   This shows all changes in the file compared with the previous commit.
