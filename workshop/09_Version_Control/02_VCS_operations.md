1. Add the current file to current changeset using the VCS Operations popup.
   Note that the color of the file changes in the Project Tool Window.
2. In Git, this does not mean the file is in the version control system now: it's in the changeset.
   Using the VCS Operations popup, add all other files in the project as well.
   Note you can use the popup on any folder.
3. All file should be green now, meaning they are added to the current changeset.
